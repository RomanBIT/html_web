        <p>During a softball game at an American oil company housing compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda
            terrorists set off a bomb, killing Americans and Saudis. While one team hijacks a car and shoots residents,
            a suicide bomber wearing a fake police uniform blows himself up, killing everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham
            of the Saudi State Police kills the carjackers. The FBI Legal Attach√© in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Fran
            Manner, calls his US colleague, Special Agent Ronald Fleury, to advise him about the attack. Manner is
            discussing the situation with DSS Special Agent Rex Burr when an ambulance full of explosives is detonated,
            killing Manner, Burr, and many others.
