        <p><strong>Terminator 2: Judgment Day[a]</strong> is a 1991 American science-fiction action film directed by
            James Cameron, who
            co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and
            Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984) and is the second installment in the Terminator
            franchise. In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator—a highly advanced
            killing machine—back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor when he
            is a child. The resistance sends back a less-advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure
            the future of humanity.

            The Terminator was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but
            work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially
            owned the film's rights. In 1990 Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the
            rights from The Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling, for US$15
            million. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the
            script. The pair frequently conferred with the special-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to
            determine if their ideas for the extensive special effects were possible. Principal photography began in
            October 1990 and lasted until March 1991, and took place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102
            million budget, making it the most-expensive film ever made at the time. The advanced visual effects, which
            include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule
            overrun, and theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before its July 3, 1991
            release.

            On its release, Terminator 2 earned $519–520.9 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1991
            worldwide, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. Critics praised the visual effects, action
            scenes, and cast, choosing Patrick's performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, but some
            criticized the film for its violent content. Terminator 2 won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA,
            and Academy Awards. Alongside tie-in promotions with brands such as Pepsi, Terminator 2 merchandise includes
            video games, comic books, novels, and T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a live-action attraction that uses filmed
            footage featuring Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong.</p>
